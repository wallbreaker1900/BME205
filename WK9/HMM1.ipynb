Four HMM Rosalind examples provide a framework that will extend throughout the course. Note that these examples operate with probabilities rather than log-probabilities or log-odds scores. The concepts of the models are consistent, however.\n","\n","Please submit the rosalind input file that you tested with. This would be one of the \"Extra Datasets\" for each problem\n","\n","## Hints\n","1) use of the python numpy module will simplify many of your operators, especially when higher precision math is required ( when products of many probabilities are calculated), or when vector operations are called for.\n","\n","2) Concepts presented in class will mirror those in the reading\n","\n","3) write your code for reusability.Â \n","\n","4) Consider your data structures carefully. You will likely need transition and emission matrices. Carefully consider how to address these. For those who are comfortable with dot product and matrix multiplication, these can dramatically simplify your code.\n","\n","Here is a template to consider."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"portuguese-management","metadata":{"id":"portuguese-management"},"source":["## Inspection Intro"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":208,"id":"naked-custody","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":168,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668555352007,"user":{"displayName":"Jill Yu","userId":"00637927308552001877"},"user_tz":480},"id":"naked-custody"},"outputs":[],"source":["class HMM:\n","    def __init__(self, emits, states, transition, emission):\n","        self.emits = emits\n","        self.states = states\n","        self.transition = transition\n","        self.emission = emission\n","        \n","    def get_transition_prob(self, cur_state, des_state):\n","        '''probability of transition from original state to destination state'''\n","        return float(self.transition[cur_state][des_state])\n","        \n","    def get_emission_prob(self, cur_state, symbol):\n","        '''probability of emission from current state to symbol'''    \n","        return float(self.emission[cur_state][symbol])\n","    \n","    def get_path_prob(self, path):\n","        '''probability that the HMM moves along a specific path (p(pi))'''\n","        #
